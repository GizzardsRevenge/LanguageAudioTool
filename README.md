# LanguageAudioTool 

This is a tool designed for batch editing language-learning MP3 files. It might be useful for other, more general, audio file batch editing.
It's very rough-and-ready, but thought it might already be in a stage where it might be useful for other people.

Basically it will automatically subdivide a file into audio sections. Then it can perform functions like changing the speed of sections, duplicating sections, splitting sections to multiple files, or any combination of these functions.

Please see readme.docx for full description, I hate the Git text format :)
