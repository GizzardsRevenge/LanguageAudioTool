Bug 1: audio sections have random trailing silence                                          OK

Terminology:

1. Section e.g. 15-45 seconds is audio = 1 audio section of 30 secs duration
2. File worker, one per file does all the tasks for that file
3. SoundChunk is a potential audiosection, normally several get squished together to make an audio section
4. Action = Job which is one task for one section e.g. play at 70% speed
